### Enabling SSH
Enabling ssh on the container is as easy as `./zos container 2 sshenable`

```bash
./zos container 2 sshenable                                                                         î‚² 30.79 ï‰“ 
ssh root@10.244.104.71

```

> also it works against the latest container created by zos 
```bash
./zos container sshenable
